# Javascript Code Quiz
> This program quizzes a user on their knowledge of Javascript. It passes multiple choice questions to a user and allows them to select a specific answer within a given timeframe (50s). If the user answers a question right, they gain a point and move on. If the user answers a question wrong, they lose 10s on the timer and move on. When the user finishes the quiz, they are prompted to enter their initials and upon entry, they are driven to a high score page that stores and displays high score values from the browser's local storage.
